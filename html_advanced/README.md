# HTML_Advanced

## HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create web pages. It consists of a series of elements, or tags, that define the structure and content of a webpage. These elements can be used to format text, add images, create links, and more. When a web browser reads an HTML file, it renders the content to display a webpage on your screen.

# How to create an HTML page from a wireframe
Analyze the Wireframe:

Carefully study the wireframe to understand its layout and structure.
Identify different sections, such as headers, navigation bars, content areas, and footers.
Plan Your HTML Structure:

Decide on the overall structure of your HTML page. Common elements include <html>, <head>, and <body>.
Create the Basic HTML Structure:

Start with the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration to specify the HTML version.
Create the <html>, <head>, and <body> elements.
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Your Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content will go here -->
</body>
</html>
Add Metadata:

Inside the <head> section, add metadata like the page title, character encoding, and any linked stylesheets or scripts.
Structure the Page Content:

Use HTML elements to structure the content according to the wireframe. For example, use <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, and <footer> tags as needed.
Create Links and Navigation:

Implement navigation menus and links using <a> elements.
Add Images and Media:

Insert images and media elements using <img>, <audio>, or <video> tags as specified in the wireframe.
Apply Styles:

If your wireframe includes styling details, you can add inline styles or link external CSS stylesheets to apply the visual design.
Test and Debug:

Test the HTML page in various web browsers to ensure it displays correctly.
Check for any errors or issues in the code and debug as necessary.
Optimize for Responsiveness:

If the wireframe indicates different layouts for different screen sizes (e.g., mobile and desktop), use CSS media queries to make your page responsive.
Validate Your HTML:

Use online HTML validators to check your code for errors and compliance with HTML standards.
Final Review:

Review the HTML page against the wireframe to make sure it matches the intended design and functionality.
Publish Your Page:

Once you're satisfied with your HTML page, you can host it on a web server or use it as part of a larger web project.
